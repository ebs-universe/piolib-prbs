/**
 * @file prbs.h
 * @brief Interface and usage of prbs generators.
 *
 * This library provides generators for psuedo random bit sequences. 
 * 
 * The following generators are currently implemented :
 * 
 *  - Linear Feedback Shift Register (16, 32, 64 bit)
 * 
 *    A 16 bit Galois LFSR implementation, intended for BER and protocol 
 *    tests. This is not cryptographically secure. The LFSR has a maximal 
 *    period of (2^16 - 1), for the correct choice of polynomial. This period 
 *    is pretty short for most random applications. Increasing the length of 
 *    the state variable, and consequently the period, has serious implications 
 *    on performance. 32 and 64 bit versions are included with the library for
 *    applications that require them.
 * 
 *    @see lfsr.h
 * 
 *  - Shrinking Generator
 * 
 *    Composed of two Galois LFSRs. This is not cryptographically secure 
 *    either. Due to the short periods of the included LFSRs, this generator 
 *    seems to have minimal applications in the real world.
 *    
 *    @see sg.h
 * 
 *  - Alternating Step Generator
 * 
 *    Composed of three Galois LFSRs. While still not cryptographically 
 *    secure, this is probably the optimal generator for relatively 
 *    non-critical random number generation. This generator produces a 
 *    reasonably good pseduo-random bit stream at a lower cost than other 
 *    'better' bit stream generation alogrithms.
 * 
 *    @see asg.h
 * 
 * Note that for all provided PRBS implementations, using default seeds and
 * polynomilals provides a deterministic PRBS. In cases where random numbers 
 * are required (as opposed to a predetermined pseudo random bitstream), the 
 * generators must be provided with true entropy.
 * 
 * One additional pseudo-random bytestream generation algorithm is available 
 * elsewhere in the EBS universe - the entropium PRNG, from AVR Crypto Lib
 * and provided from the EBS cryptolib library. Entropium uses a 512 bit 
 * core and SHA256 and XOR to generate the bytestream. Cryptographic 
 * properties of entropium don't seem to available. However, entropium is 
 * significantly more expensive in all respects. 
 * 
 * The following PRNGs look amusing but are not yet included here : 
 * 
 *  - TinyMT : The 32-bit variant of the Mersenne Twister may be able to run
 *             on constrained platforms, but seems still too heavy to 
 *             prioritize implementation
 * 
 *  - PCG : The permuted congruential generator, while probably heavier than
 *          LFSRs, may provide the best of multiple worlds. Implementation is
 *          currently deferred pending performance testing on the rand() LCG.
 * 
 * Of course, GCC/glibc's stdlib provides an LCG based rand() function which
 * can be used as well. A serious attempt to provide a stripped down version 
 * is not made. The combination of multiplication, non-2^N modulus, and 
 * constraints on state size seem unlikely to make it worth the effort beyond
 * whatever stdlib provides.
