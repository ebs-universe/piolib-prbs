/**
 * @file lfsr.h
 * @brief Interface and usage of the lfsr prbs generator.
 *
 * This file provides the Linear Feedback Shift Register generator for 
 * psuedo random bit sequences. It is intended for use in BER and protocol 
 * tests and should not be considered crytptographically secure. 
 * 
 * An alternating step generator or shrinking generator can be constructed 
 * of these LFSRs which have relatively better cryptographic properties. 
 * Implementations of the SG and ASG based on the LFSR presented here are 
 * included in the library and can be found in sg.h and asg.h.
 * 
 * This library uses hardcoded polynomials for performace reasons. 
 * Polynomials need to be primitive and cannot be generated from entropy in 
 * any case. Primitive polynomials from Xilinx application note XAPP052 are
 * used by default, this can be changed only by changing the preprocessor 
 * definitions in this file. If multiple LFSRs are instantiated, they will 
 * all use the same polynomials. While non-ideal, this is not as bad as it 
 * sounds. Any reasonable polynomial which works with randomly generated 
 * seeds will have exactly the same period anyway. The LFSR's seed can be 
 * set to a different value using the AddEntropy function.
 * 
 * @see <https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp052.pdf>
